Here A and B intentionally co-operate in the commission of murder and as each of them does an act by which the death is \\ncaused, they are both guilty of the offence though their acts are separate. \\n(b) A and B are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of Z, a prisoner, alternatively for six hours at a time. A and B, \\nintending to cause Z's death, knowingly co-operate in causing that effect by illegally omitting, each during the time of his \\nattendance, to furnish Z with food supplied to them for that purpose. Z dies of hunger. Both A and B, are guilty of the murder of \\nZ. \\n(c) A, a jailor, has the charge of Z, a prisoner. A, intending to cause Z's death, illegally omits to supply Z with food; in \\nconsequence of which Z is much reduced in strength, but the starvation is not sufficient to cause his death. A is dismissed from \\nhis office, and B succeeds him. B, without collusion or co-operation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food, knowing that \\nhe is likely thereby to cause Z's death. Z dies of hunger. B is guilty of murder, but, as A did not co-operate with B. A is guilty \\nonly of an attempt to commit murder. \\n38. Persons concerned in criminal act may be guilty of different offences.—Where several \\npersons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be guilty of different \\noffences by means of that act. \\nIllustration \\nA attacks Z under such circumstances of grave provocation that his killing of Z would be only culpable homicide not \\namounting to murder. B, having ill-will towards Z and intending to kill him, and not having been subject to the provocation, \\nassists A in killing Z. Here, though A and B are both engaged in causing Z's death, B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of \\nculpable homicide. \\n                                                          \\n1.

Act likely to cause harm, but done without criminal intent, and to prevent other harm.—\\nNothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause \\nharm, if it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good faith for the purpose of \\npreventing or avoiding other harm to person or property. \\nExplanation.—It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was \\nof such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that \\nit was likely to cause harm. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly and without any fault or negligence on his part, finds himself in such a \\nposition that, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board, \\nunless he changes the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with \\nonly two passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the \\nboat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, \\nthough he may run down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of \\nfact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down C. \\n(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. He does this with the intention \\nin good faith of saving human life or property. Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so \\nimminent as to excuse A's act, A is not guilty of the offence. \\n82. Act of a child under seven years of age.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under \\nseven years of age.  \\n83. Act of a child above seven and under twelve of immature understanding.—Nothing is an \\noffence which is done by a child above seven years of age and under twelve, who has not attained \\nsufficient maturity of understanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his conduct on that \\noccasion. \\n84. Act of a person of unsound mind.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the \\ntime of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that \\nhe is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law. \\n85. Act of a person incapable of judgment by reason of intoxication caused against his will.—\\nNothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of intoxication, \\nincapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong, or contrary to  \\nlaw; provided that the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or \\nagainst his will. \\n86. Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is intoxicated.—\\nIn cases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge or intent, a person \\nwho does the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same knowledge \\nas he would have had if he had not been intoxicated, unless the thing which intoxicated him was \\nadministered to him without his knowledge or against his will. \\n87. Act not intended and not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, done by \\nconsent.—Nothing which is not intended to cause death, or grievous hurt, and which is not known by the \\ndoer to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause,\"),\n",

This agreement implies the consent of each to suffer any harm which \\nin the course of such fencing, may be caused without foul play; and if A, while playing fairly, hurts Z, A commits no offence. \\n88. Act not intended to cause death, done by consent in good faith for person's benefit.—\\nNothing, which is not intented to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or \\nbe intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for whose \\nbenefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that \\nharm, or to take the risk of that harm. \\nIllustration \\nA, a surgeon, knowing that a particular operation is likely to cause the death of Z, who suffers under the painful complaint, \\nbut not intending to cause Z's death, and intending, in good faith, Z's benefit, performs that operation on Z, with Z's consent.

Act done in good faith for benefit of child or insane person, by or by consent of guardian.—\\nNothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of age, or of unsound \\nmind, by or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian or other person having lawful charge of \\nthat person, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause \\nor be known by the doer to be likely to cause to that person: Provided— \\nProvisos. First.—That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or to the \\nattempting to cause death; \\nSecondly.—That this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the person doing \\nit knows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous \\nhurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; \\nThirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to the \\nattempting to cause grievous hurt, unless it be for the purpose of preventing death or grievous hurt; or \\nthe curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; \\nFourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing \\nof which offence it would not extend. \\nIllustration \\nA, in good faith, for his child's benefit without his child's consent, has his child cut for the stone by a surgeon knowing it to \\nbe likely that the operation will cause the child's death, but not intending to cause the child's death. A is within the exception,  \\ninasmuch as his object was the cure of the child. \\n90. Consent known to be given under fear or misconception.—A consent is not such a consent as \\nis intended by any section of this Code, if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a \\nmisconception of fact, and if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that the consent \\nwas given in consequence of such fear or misconception; or \\nConsent of insane person.—if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or \\nintoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent; or \\nConsent of child.—unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a person \\nwho is under twelve years of age. \\n91. Exclusion of acts which are offences independently of harm cause.—The exceptions in \\nsections 87, 88 and 89 do not extend to acts which are offences independently of any harm which they \\nmay cause, or be intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person giving the consent, or \\non whose behalf the consent is given. \\nIllustration \\nCausing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the woman) is an offence \\nindependently of any harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman. Therefore, it is not an offence “by reason of \\nsuch harm”; and the consent of the woman or of her guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act.\"),\n",

Act done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent.—Nothing is an offence by \\nreason of any harm which it may cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even without \\nthat person's consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent, \\nor if that person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful charge of \\nhim from whom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit: Provided— \\nProvisos.

A, a surgeon, finds that Z requires to be trepanned. A, not intending Z's \\ndeath, but in good faith, for Z's benefit, performs the trepan before Z recovers his power of judging for himself. A has committed \\nno offence. \\n(b) Z is carried off by a tiger. A fires at the tiger knowing it to be likely that the shot may kill Z, but not intending to kill Z, \\nand in good faith intending Z's benefit. A's ball gives Z a mortal wound. A has committed no offence. \\n(c) A, a surgeon, sees a child suffer an accident which is likely to prove fatal unless an operation be immediately performed. \\nThere is no time to apply to the child's guardian. A performs the operation in spite of the entreaties of the child, intending, in \\ngood faith, the child's benefit. A has committed no offence. \\n(d) A is in a house which is on fire, with Z, a child. People below hold out a blanket. A drops the child from the house stop, \\nknowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the child, but not intending to kill the child, and intending, in good faith, the child's \\nbenefit. Here, even if the child is killed by the fall, A has committed no offence. \\nExplanation.—Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the meaning of sections 88, 89 and 92. \\n93. Communication made in good faith.—No communication made in good faith is an offence by \\nreason of any harm to the person to whom it is made, if it is made for the benefit of that person. \\nIllustration \\nA, a surgeon, in good faith, communicates to a patient his opinion that he cannot live. The patient dies in consequence of the \\nshock. A has committed no offence, though he knew it to be likely that the communication might cause the patient's death. \\n94. Act to which a person is compelled by threats.—Except murder, and offences against the State \\npunishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by \\nthreats, which, at the time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to that person \\nwill otherwise be the consequence: Provided the person doing the act did not of his own accord, or from a \\nreasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation by which \\nhe became subject to such constraint. \\nExplanation 1.—A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat of being beaten, joins a \\ngang of dacoits, knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of this exception, on the ground of \\nhis having been compelled by his associates to do anything that is an offence by law. \\nExplanation 2.—A person seized by a gang of dacoits, and forced, by threat of instant death, to do a \\nthing which is an offence by law; for example, a smith compelled to take his tools and to force the door of \\na house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is entitled to the benefit of this exception. \\n95. Act causing slight harm.—Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to \\ncause, or that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of \\nordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm. \\n \\nOf the Right of Private Defence \\n96.

Right of private defence of the body and of property.—Every person has a right, subject to the \\nrestrictions contained in section 99, to defend— \\nFirst.—His own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the human \\nbody; \\nSecondly.—The property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against \\nany act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass, or \\nwhich is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass. \\n98. Right of private defence against the act of a person of unsound mind, etc.—When an act, \\nwhich would otherwise be a certain offence, is not that offence, by reason of the youth, the want of \\nmaturity of understanding, the unsoundness of mind or the intoxication of the person doing that act, or by \\nreason of any misconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of private defence \\nagainst that act which he would have if the act were that offence. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) Z, under the influence of madness, attempts to kill A; Z is guilty of no offence. But A has the same right of private \\ndefence which he would have if Z were sane. \\n(b) A enters by night a house which he is legally entitled to enter. Z, in good faith, taking A for a house-breaker, attacks A. \\nHere Z, by attacking A under this misconception, commits no offence. But A has the same right of private defence against Z, \\nwhich he would have if Z were not acting under that misconception. \\n99. Acts against which there is no right of private defence.—There is no right of private defence \\nagainst an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or \\nattempted to be done by a public servant acting in good faith under colour of his office, though that act \\nmay not be strictly justifiable by law. \\nThere is no right of private defence against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension \\nof death or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant acting in \\ngood faith under colour of his office though that direction may not be strictly justifiable by law. \\nThere is no right of private defence in cases in which there is time to have recourse to protection of \\nthe public authorities. \\nExtent to which the right may be exercised.—The right of private defence in no case extends to the \\ninflicting of more harm than it is necessary to inflict for the purpose ofdefence. \\nExplanation 1.—A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an act done, or \\nattempted to be done, by a public servant, as such, unless he knows or has reason to believe, that the \\nperson doing the act is such public servant. \\nExplanation 2.—A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an act done, or \\nattempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant, unless he knows, or has reason to believe, that \\nthe person doing the act is acting by such direction, or unless such person states the authority under which \\nhe acts, or if he has authority in writing, unless he produces such authority, if demanded. \\n100.

Abetment of a thing.—A person abets the doing of a thing, who— \\nFirst.—Instigates any person to do that thing; or \\nSecondly.—Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that \\nthing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of \\nthat thing; or \\nThirdly.—Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing. \\nExplanation 1.—A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material \\nfact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing \\nto be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing. \\nIllustration \\nA, a public officer, is authorised by a warrant from a Court of Justice to apprehend Z. B, knowing that fact and also that C is \\nnot Z, wilfully represents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally causes A to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation the \\napprehension of C. \\nExplanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in \\norder to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid \\nthe doing of that act. \\n108. Abettor.—A person abets an offence, who abets either the commission of an offence, or the \\ncommission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing \\nan offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor. \\nExplanation 1.—The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an offence although \\nthe abettor may not himself be bound to do that act. \\nExplanation 2.—To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act abetted should \\nbe committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder. \\n(b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers from the wound. A is guilty of \\ninstigating B to commit murder. \\nExplanation 3.—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing an \\noffence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor or any guilty \\nintention or knowledge.'),\n",

Here A, whether the act be committed or \\nnot, is guilty of abetting an offence. \\n(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z's death. \\nB, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z's death. Here, though B was not capable \\nby law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an \\noffence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. \\n(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of the unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of \\nknowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's \\ninstigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to \\nthe punishment provided for that offence. \\n(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out of Z's possession. A \\ninduces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing it to be A's \\nproperty. B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of \\nabetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. \\nExplanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is \\nalso an offence. \\nIllustration \\nA instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in \\nconsequence of B's instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B \\nto commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment. \\nExplanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that \\nthe abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the \\nconspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. \\nIllustration \\nA concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer the poison. B then explains the plan to C \\nmentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A's name. C agrees to procure the poison, and \\nprocures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in \\nconsequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which \\nZ has been murdered.

Punishment of abetment if person abetted does act with different intention from that of \\nabettor.—Whoever abets the commission of an offence shall, if the person abetted does the act with a \\ndifferent intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with the punishment provided for \\nthe offence which would have been committed if the act had been done with the intention or knowledge \\nof the abettor and with no other. \\n111.

Giving false evidence.—Whoever, being legally bound by an oath or by an express provision of \\nlaw to state the truth, or being bound by law to make a declaration upon any subject, makes any statement \\nwhich is false, and which he either knows or believes to be false or does not believe to be true, is said to \\ngive false evidence. \\nExplanation 1.—A statement is within the meaning of this section, whether it is made verbally or \\notherwise. \\nExplanation 2.—A false statement as to the belief of the person attesting is within the meaning of this \\nsection, and a person may be guilty of giving false evidence by stating that he believes a thing which he \\ndoes not believe, as well as by stating that he knows a thing which he does not know. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A, in support of a just claim which B has against Z for one thousand rupees, falsely swears on a trial that he heard Z \\nadmit the justice of B's claim. A has given false evidence. \\n(b) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he believes a certain signature to be the handwriting of Z, when \\nhe does not believe it to be the handwriting of Z. Here A states that which he knows to be false, and therefore gives false \\nevidence. \\n(c) A, knowing the general character of Z's handwriting, states that he believes a certain signature to be the handwriting of \\nZ; A in good faith believing it to be so. Here A's statement is merely as to his belief, and is true as to his belief, and therefore, \\nalthough the signature may not be the handwriting of Z, A has not given false evidence. \\n(d) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he knows that Z was at a particular place on a particular day, not \\nknowing anything upon the subject. A gives false evidence whether Z was at that place on the day named or not. \\n(e) A, an interpreter or translator, gives or certifies as a true interpretation or translation of a statement or document which \\nhe is bound by oath to interpret or translate truly, that which is not and which he does not believe to be a true interpretation or \\ntranslation. A has given false evidence. \\n192. Fabricating false evidence.—Whoever causes any circumstance to exist or 1[makes any false \\nentry in any book or record, or electronic record or makes any document or electronic record containing a \\nfalse statement,] intending that such circumstance, false entry or false statement may appear in evidence \\nin a judicial proceeding, or in a proceeding taken by law before a public servant as such, or before an \\narbitrator, and that such circumstance, false entry or false statement, so appearing in evidence, may cause \\nany person who in such proceeding is to form an opinion upon the evidence, to entertain an erroneous \\nopinion touching any point material to the result of such proceeding is said “to fabricate false evidence”. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A puts jewels into a box belonging to Z, with the intention that they may be found in that box, and that this circumstance \\nmay cause Z to be convicted of theft. A has fabricated false evidence. \\n(b) A makes a false entry in his shop-book for the purpose of using it as corroborative evidence in a Court of Justice. A has \\nfabricated false evidence. \\n(c) A, with the intention of causing Z to be convicted of a criminal conspiracy, writes a letter in imitation of Z's handwriting, \\npurporting to be addressed to an accomplice in such criminal conspiracy, and puts the letter in a place which he knows that the \\nofficers of the police are likely to search. A has fabricated false evidence. \\n193. Punishment for false evidence.—Whoever intentionally gives false evidence in any stage of a \\njudicial proceeding, or fabricates false evidence for the purpose of being used in any stage of a judicial \\nproceeding, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to \\nseven years, and shall also be liable to fine, \\nand whoever intentionally gives or fabricates false evidence in any other case, shall be punished with \\nimprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to \\nfine. \\n                                                          \\n1.

A commits murder. \\n(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention \\nof causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been \\nsufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is \\nlabouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of \\nhealth, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such \\nbodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. \\n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. \\nZ dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z's death. \\n(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although \\nhe may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. \\nException 1.—When culpable homicide is not murder.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the \\noffender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death \\nof the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. \\nThe above exception is subject to the following provisos:— \\nFirst.—That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for \\nkilling or doing harm to any person. \\nSecondly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public \\nservant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant. \\nThirdly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of \\nprivate defence. \\nExplanation.—Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from \\namounting to murder is a question of fact. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child. This is murder, \\ninasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in \\ndoing an act caused by the provocation. \\n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing \\nhimself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable \\nhomicide.\"),\n",

A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, \\ninasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers. \\n(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A's deposition, and that A has \\nperjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder. \\n(e) A attempts to pull Z's nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing \\nso. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was \\ngiving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence. \\n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B's rage, and \\nto cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only \\nculpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder. \\nException 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, in the exercise in good faith of the \\nright of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the \\ndeath of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and \\nwithout any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. \\nIllustration \\nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the \\nassault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has \\nnot committed murder, but only culpable homicide. \\nException 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a \\npublic servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and \\ncauses death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due \\ndischarge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is \\ncaused. \\nException 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden \\nfight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender's having taken undue \\nadvantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. \\nExplanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first \\nassault. \\nException 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above \\nthe age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent. \\nIllustration \\nA, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years of age to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z's \\nyouth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder. \\n301. Culpable homicide by causing death of person other than person whose death was \\nintended.—If a person, by doing anything which he intends or knows to be likely to cause death, \\ncommits culpable homicide by causing the death of any person, whose death he neither intends nor knows \\nhimself to be likely to cause, the culpable homicide committed by the offender is of the description of \\nwhich it would have been if he had caused the death of the person whose death he intended or knew \\nhimself to be likely to cause. \\n302. Punishment for murder.—Whoever commits murder shall be punished with death, or \\n1[imprisonment for life], and shall also be liable to fine. \\n303. Punishment for murder by life-convict.—Whoever, being under sentence of 1[imprisonment \\nfor life], commits murder shall be punished with death. \\n304. Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.—Whoever commits culpable \\nhomicide not amounting to murder shall be punished with 1[imprisonment for life], or imprisonment of \\neither description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine, if the act by \\nwhich the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing such bodily injury as \\nis likely to cause death; \\n                                                          \\n1.

Force.—A person is said to use force to another if he causes motion, change of motion, or \\ncessation of motion to that other, or if he causes to any substance such motion, or change of motion, or \\ncessation of motion as brings that substance into contact with any part of that other's body, or with \\nanything which that other is wearing or carrying, or with anything so situated that such contact affects that \\nother's sense of feeling: Provided that the person causing the motion, or change of motion, or cessation of \\nmotion, causes that motion, change of motion, or cessation of motion in one of the three ways hereinafter \\ndescribed: \\nFirst.—By his own bodily power. \\nSecondly.—By disposing any substance in such a manner that the motion or change or cessation of \\nmotion takes place without any further act on his part, or on the part of any other person. \\nThirdly.—By inducing any animal to move, to change its motion, or to cease to move. \\n350. Criminal force.—Whoever intentionally uses force to any person, without that person's consent, \\nin order to the committing of any offence, or intending by the use of such force to cause, or knowing it to \\nbe likely that by the use of such force he will cause injury, fear or annoyance to the person to whom the \\nforce is used, is said to use criminal force to that other. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) Z is sitting in a moored boat on a river. A unfastens the moorings, and thus intentionally causes the boat to drift down the \\nstream. Here A intentionally causes motion to Z, and he does this by disposing substances in such a manner that the motion is \\nproduced without any other action on any person's part. A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so \\nwithout Z's consent, in order to the committing of any offence, or intending or knowing it to be likely that this use of force will \\ncause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \\n(b) Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z's horses, and thereby causes them to quicken their pace. Here A has caused change of \\nmotion to Z by inducing the animals to change their motion. A has therefore used force to Z; and if A has done this without Z's \\nconsent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \\n(c) Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole and stops the palanquin. Here A has caused cessation of \\nmotion to Z, and he has done this by his own bodily power. A has therefore used force to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally, \\nwithout Z's consent, in order to the commission of an offence. A has used criminal force to Z. \\n(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily power moved his own person so as to bring \\nit into contact with Z. He has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z's consent, intending or \\nknowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z. \\n(e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus brought into contact with Z, or with Z's \\nclothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will strike water and dash up the water against Z's clothes or something carried \\nby Z. Here, if the throwing of the stone produce the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with Z, or Z's clothes, A \\nhas used force to Z; and if he did so without Z's consent, intending thereby to injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal \\nforce to Z. \\n(f) A intentionally pulls up a woman's veil. Here A intentionally uses force to her, and if he does so without her consent \\nintending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to her. \\n(g) Z is bathing. A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. Here A intentionally by his own bodily power \\ncauses such motion in the boiling water as brings that water into contact with Z, or with other water so situated that such contact \\nmust affect Z's sense of feeling; A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done this without Z's consent \\nintending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force. \\n(h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z's consent. Here, if A intends to cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, he uses \\ncriminal force to Z. \\n351. Assault.—Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely \\nthat such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that \\ngesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault. \\nExplanation.—Mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a person uses may give \\nto his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an \\nassault. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A shakes his fist at Z, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that A is about to strike \\nZ. A has committed an assault. \\n(b) A begins to unloose the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to \\nbelieve that he is about to cause the dog to attack Z.

Here, if A's intention be dishonestly to take the \\ndog out of Z's possession without Z's consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A. \\n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may \\ndishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure. \\n(d) A being Z's servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z's \\nconsent. A has committed theft. \\n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a \\ngoldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z's possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and A has \\nnot committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. \\n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z's possession, and if A \\ndishonestly removes it, A commits theft. \\n(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he \\nmay commit criminal misappropriation of property. \\n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear \\nof search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the \\nintention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the \\nring, commits theft. \\n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for \\nwhich the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand, \\nand carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as \\nwhat he did was not done dishonestly.  \\n(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes \\nthe watch out of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, \\ninasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. \\n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's possession without Z's consent, not having paid what he \\nborrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. \\n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession without Z's consent, with the intention of keeping it until he \\nobtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft. \\n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express \\nconsent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived \\nthat he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft. \\n(n) A asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it \\nis probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was A's impression, A has not committed \\ntheft. \\n(o) A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such \\nproperty as she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft. \\n(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes that property out of B's possession. \\nHere, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft. \\n379. Punishment for theft.—Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of either \\ndescription for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both. \\nSTATE AMENDMENT \\nGujarat.— \\nIn the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (XLV of 1860), after section 379, the following sections shall be \\ninserted, namely:— \\n379A. Snatching.—(1) Whoever, with the intention to commit theft, suddenly or quickly or forcibly \\nseizes or secures or grabs or takes away fromany person or from his physical possession any moveable \\nproperty, and makes or attempt to make escape with such property, is said to commit snatching. \\n (2) Whoever attempts to commit snatching shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a \\nterm which shall  not  be less than  five years but which may extend to ten years, and with fine which \\nmay extend to twenty-five thousand rupees. \\n(3) Whoever commits snatching shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which \\nshall not be less than seven years but which may extend to ten years, and with fine which may extend \\nto twenty-five thousand rupees.\"),\n",

Here A has \\ncommitted theft, and, in order to the committing of that theft, has voluntarily caused wrongful restraint to Z. A has therefore \\ncommitted robbery. \\n(b) A meets Z on the high road, shows a pistol, and demands Z's purse. Z, in consequence, surrenders his purse. Here A has \\nextorted the purse from Z by putting him in fear of instant hurt, and being at the time of committing the extortion in his presence. \\nA has therefore committed robbery. \\n(c) A meets Z and Z's child on the high road. A takes the child, and threatens to filing it down a precipice, unless Z delivers \\nhis purse. Z, in consequence, delivers his purse. Here A has extorted the purse from Z, by causing Z to be in fear of instant hurt to \\nthe child who is there present. A has therefore committed robbery on Z. \\n(d) A obtains property from Z by saying “Your child is in the hands of my gang, and will be put to death unless you send us \\nten thousand rupees”. This is extortion, and punishable as such: but it is not robbery, unless Z is put in fear of the instant death of \\nhis child. \\n391.

A is not guilty of theft; but if A, after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property \\nto his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section. \\n(b) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express \\nconsent. Here, if A was under the impression that he had Z's implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, A has \\nnot committed theft. But, if A afterwards sells the book for his own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this section. \\n(c) A and B, being, joint owners of a horse, A takes the horse out of B's possession, intending to use it. Here, as A has a right \\nto use the horse, he does not dishonestly misappropriate it. But, if A sells the horse and appropriates the whole proceeds to his \\nown use, he is guilty of an offence under this section. \\nExplanation 1.—A dishonest misappropriation for a time only is a misappropriation within the \\nmeaning of this section. \\nIllustration \\nA finds a Government promissory note belonging to Z, bearing a blank endorsement. A, knowing that the note belongs to Z, \\npledges it with a banker as a security or a loan, intending at a future time to restore it to Z.

A, in order to defraud B, adds cipher to the 10,000, and makes the sum \\n1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery.  \\n(b) A, without Z's authority, affixes Z's seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the intention of \\nselling the estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B the purchase-money. A has committed forgery. \\n(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently \\nfills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand rupees. A commits forgery. \\n(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable and authorizes B to fill up the cheque \\nby inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the purpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting \\nthe sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery. \\n(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B's authority, intending to discount it as a genuine bill with a banker and \\nintending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the \\nsecurity of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery. \\n(f) Z's will contains these words—“I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided between A, B and C.” A dishonestly scratches \\nout B's name, intending that it may be believed that the whole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery. \\n(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order by writing on the bill the words “Pay to Z or his order” \\nand signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words “Pay to Z or his order”, and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank \\nendorsement. B commits forgery. \\n(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated \\nsix months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to \\nZ. A has committed forgery. \\n(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the \\nwill according to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery. \\n(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B's name without B's authority, certifying that A is a man of good character and in distressed \\ncircumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made a false \\ndocument in order to induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery. \\n(k) A without B's authority writes a letter and signs it in B's name certifying to A's character, intending thereby to obtain employment under \\nZ. A has committed forgery inasmuch as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express or \\nimplied contract for service. \\nExplanation 1.—A man’s signature of his own name may amount to forgery. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was drawn by another person of the same \\nname. A has committed forgery. \\n(b) A writes the word “accepted” on a piece of paper and signs it with Z's name, in order that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of \\nexchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws \\nthe bill upon the paper pursuant to A's intention, B is also guilty of forgery. \\n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending \\nto cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery. \\n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, executes a lease \\nof the estate, to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause \\nit to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery by antedating it. \\n(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A's benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors; and in order to \\ngive a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the note, intending \\nthat it may be believed to have been made before A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery under the first head of the \\ndefinition. \\nExplanation 2.—The making of a false document in the name of a fictious person, intending it to be believed that the document was made \\nby a real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may \\namount to forgery. \\nIllustration \\nA draws a bill of exchange upon a fictious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in the name of such fictitious person with intent to negotiate \\nit.

Act likely to cause harm, but done without criminal intent, and to prevent other harm.—\\nNothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge t hat it is likely to cause \\nharm, if it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good f aith for the purpose of \\npreventing or avoiding other harm to person or property. \\nExplanation.—It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was \\nof such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the ac t with the knowledge that \\nit was likely to cause harm. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly and without any f ault or negligence on his part, finds himself in such a \\nposition that, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board , \\nunless he changes the course of his vessel, and that, by changing  his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with \\nonly two passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the \\nboat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, \\nthough he may run down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matte r of \\nfact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down C. \\n(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conf lagration from spreading. He does this with the intention \\nin good faith of saving human life or property.

Act of a person incapable of judgment by reason of intoxication caused against his will .—\\nNothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of intoxication, \\nincapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either w rong, or contrary to  \\nlaw; provided that the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him w ithout his knowledge or \\nagainst his will. \\n86.

A is within the exception,   \\ninasmuch as his object was the cure of the child. \\n90. Consent known to be given under fear or misconception .—A consent is not such a consent as \\nis intended by any section of this Code, if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a \\nmisconception of fact, and if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to bel ieve, that the consent \\nwas given in consequence of such fear or misconception; or \\nConsent of insane person .—if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or \\nintoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent; or \\nConsent of child.—unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a person \\nwho is under twelve years of age. \\n91.

Therefore, it is not an offence “by reason of \\nsuch harm”; and the consent of the woman or of her guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act.\"),\n",

Here A, whether the act be committed or \\nnot, is guilty of abetting an offence. \\n(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under se ven years of age, to do an act which causes Z's death. \\nB, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z's death. Here, though B was not capable \\nby law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an \\noffence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. \\n(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of th e unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of \\nknowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong o r contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's \\ninstigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting  the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to \\nthe punishment provided for that offence. \\n(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take p roperty belonging to Z out of Z's possession. A \\ninduces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing it to be A's \\nproperty.

B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and  C commits that offence in \\nconsequence of B's instigation. B is liable to be punished for his off ence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B \\nto commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment. \\nExplanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspira cy that \\nthe abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficien t if he engages in the \\nconspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. \\nIllustration \\nA concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall a dminister the poison. B then explains the plan to C \\nmentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A's name. C agrees to procure the poison, and \\nprocures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in \\nconsequence.

Abettor when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted and for act done .—If the act \\nfor which the abettor is liable under the last preceding section is commit ted in addition to the act abetted, \\nand constitute a distinct offence, the abettor is liable to punishment for each of the offences. \\nIllustration \\nA instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant. B, in consequence resists that distress. In offering the \\nresistance, B voluntarily causes grievous hurt to the officer executing the d istress. As B has committed both the offence of \\nresisting the distress, and the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, B is liable to punishment for both these offences; and, \\nif A knew that B was likely voluntarily to cause grievous hurt in resisting the distress A will also be liable to punishment for each \\nof the offences. \\n113. Liability of abettor for an effect caused by the act abetted different fro m that intended by \\nthe abettor.—When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a particular \\neffect, and an act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment, causes a different effect \\nfrom that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect cause d, in the same manner and to the \\nsame extent as if he had abetted the act with the intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the \\nact abetted was likely to cause that effect. \\nIllustration \\nA instigates B to cause grievous hurt to Z.

Z, believing the ground to be firm, treads on  it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable \\nhomicide. \\n(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending  to cause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z's death, \\ninduces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z. Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable \\nhomicide. \\n(c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, w ho is behind a bush; A not knowing that he was there. \\nHere, although A was doing an unlawful act, he was not guilty o f culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill B, or to cause  \\ndeath by doing an act that he knew was likely to cause death. \\nExplanation 1. —A person who causes bodily injury to another who is labouring under a disorder, \\ndisease or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other, shall be deemed to have caused \\nhis death. \\n                                                           \\n1.

But it ma y \\namount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has been brought \\nforth, though the child may not have breathed or been completely born. \\n300. Murder.—Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder, if the act by \\nwhich the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or— \\n2ndly.—If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely \\nto cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or— \\n3rdly.—If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury \\nintended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or— \\n4thly.—If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous t hat it must, in all \\nprobability, cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and comm its such act without \\nany excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits murder. \\n(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is like ly to cause his death, strikes him with the intention \\nof causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is g uilty of murder, although the blow might not have been \\nsufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is \\nlabouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in  the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of \\nhealth, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such \\nbodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. \\n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cau se the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. \\nZ dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z's death. \\n(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although  \\nhe may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. \\nException 1 .—When culpable homicide is not murder .—Culpable homicide is not murder if the \\noffender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, c auses the death \\nof the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. \\nThe above exception is subject to the following provisos:— \\nFirst.—That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excus e for \\nkilling or doing harm to any person. \\nSecondly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public  \\nservant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant. \\nThirdly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of \\nprivate defence. \\nExplanation.—Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from \\namounting to murder is a question of fact. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child. This is murder, \\ninasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and th e death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in  \\ndoing an act caused by the provocation. \\n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provoc ation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing \\nhimself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable \\nhomicide.\"),\n",

A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, \\ninasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers. \\n(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does no t believe a word of A's deposition, and that A has \\nperjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder. \\n(e) A attempts to pull Z's nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of p rivate defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing \\nso. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, an d kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was \\ngiving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence. \\n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a by stander, intending to take advantage of B's rage, and \\nto cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only \\nculpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder. \\nException 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, in the exercise in good faith of t he \\nright of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to h im by law and causes the \\ndeath of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without prem editation, and \\nwithout any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. \\nIllustration \\nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievo us hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the \\nassault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other m eans prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has \\nnot committed murder, but only culpable homicide. \\nException 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding  a \\npublic servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and \\ncauses death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessar y for the due \\ndischarge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the perso n whose death is \\ncaused. \\nException 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation i n a sudden \\nfight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender's having t aken undue \\nadvantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. \\nExplanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first \\nassault. \\nException 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above \\nthe age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent. \\nIllustration \\nA, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years o f age to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z's \\nyouth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder. \\n301. Culpable homicide by causing death of person other than person whose death was \\nintended.—If a person, by doing anything which he intends or knows to be likely to ca use death, \\ncommits culpable homicide by causing the death of any person, whose death he neither intends nor knows \\nhimself to be likely to cause, the culpable homicide committed by the offender i s of the description of \\nwhich it would have been if he had caused the death of the person whose death he intended or k new \\nhimself to be likely to cause. \\n302.

Punishment for murder by life-convict .—Whoever, being under sentence of 1[imprisonment \\nfor life], commits murder shall be punished with death. \\n304.

Criminal force.—Whoever intentionally uses force to any person, without that person's consent, \\nin order to the committing of any offence, or intending by the use of such force to cause, or knowing it to \\nbe likely that by the use of such force he will cause injury, fear or annoyanc e to the person to whom th e \\nforce is used, is said to use criminal force to that other. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) Z is sitting in a moored boat on a river. A unfastens the moorings, and thus intentionally causes the boat to drift down the \\nstream. Here A intentionally causes motion to Z, and he does this by disposing substances in such a manner that the motion is \\nproduced without any other action on any person's part. A ha s therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so \\nwithout Z's consent, in order to the committing of any offence , or intending or knowing it to be likely that this use of force will \\ncause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \\n(b) Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z's horses, and thereby causes them to  quicken their pace. Here A has caused change of \\nmotion to Z by inducing the animals to change their motion. A has th erefore used force to Z; and if A has done this without Z's \\nconsent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \\n(c) Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole a nd stops the palanquin. Here A has caused cessation of \\nmotion to Z, and he has done this by his own bodily power. A has therefore used force to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally, \\nwithout Z's consent, in order to the commission of an offence. A has used criminal force to Z. \\n(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own b odily power moved his own person so as to bring \\nit into contact with Z. He has therefore intentionally used force to Z; a nd if he has done so without Z's consent, intending or \\nknowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z. \\n(e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus brought into contact with Z, or with Z's \\nclothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will strike water and d ash up the water against Z's clothes or something carried \\nby Z. Here, if the throwing of the stone produce the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with Z, or Z's clothes, A \\nhas used force to Z; and if he did so without Z's consent, inten ding thereby to injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal \\nforce to Z. \\n(f) A intentionally pulls up a woman's veil. Here A intentionally uses fo rce to her, and if he does so without her consent \\nintending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to her. \\n(g) Z is bathing. A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boil ing. Here A intentionally by his own bodily power \\ncauses such motion in the boiling water as brings that water into con tact with Z, or with other water so situated that such contact \\nmust affect Z's sense of feeling; A has therefore intentionally used forc e to Z; and if he has done this without Z's consent \\nintending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force. \\n(h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z's consent. Here, if  A intends to cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, he uses \\ncriminal force to Z. \\n351. Assault.—Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be l ikely \\nthat such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who m akes that \\ngesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault. \\nExplanation.—Mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a person uses may give \\nto his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparat ions amount to an \\nassault. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A shakes his fist at Z, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that A is about to stri ke \\nZ. A has committed an assault. \\n(b) A begins to unloose the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intending or kn owing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to \\nbelieve that he is about to cause the dog to attack Z.

A has committed theft. \\n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a wa rehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a \\ngoldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z's possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and A has \\nnot committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. \\n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occup ies. Here the ring is in Z's possession, and if A \\ndishonestly removes it, A commits theft. \\n(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he \\nmay commit criminal misappropriation of property. \\n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not ven turing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear \\nof search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is hig hly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the \\nintention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it w hen the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the \\nring, commits theft. \\n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to h is shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for \\nwhich the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters th e shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand, \\nand carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed crimi nal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as \\nwhat he did was not done dishonestly.  \\n(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the wa tch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes \\nthe watch out of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z o f the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, \\ninasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. \\n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's poss ession without Z's consent, not having paid what he \\nborrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. \\n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession without Z's co nsent, with the intention of keeping it until he \\nobtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft. \\n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence,  and takes away a book without Z's express \\nconsent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived \\nthat he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft. \\n(n) A asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and cl othes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it \\nis probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorised to give aw ay alms. If this was A's impression, A has not committed \\ntheft. \\n(o) A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives a valuable property, which A  knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such \\nproperty as she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft. \\n(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes that property out of B's possession. \\nHere, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft. \\n379.

A, in order to defraud B, adds cipher to the 10,000, and makes the sum \\n1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery.  \\n(b) A, without Z's authority, affixes Z's seal to a document  purporting to be a conveyance of an estate from Z to  A, with the intention of \\nselling the estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B the purchase-money. A has committed forgery. \\n(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently \\nfills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand rupees.

Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker  by leading him to suppose that he had the \\nsecurity of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery. \\n(f) Z's will contains these words—“I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided between A, B and C.” A dishonestly scratches \\nout B's name, intending that it may be believed that the whole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery. \\n(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order by writing on the bill the words “Pay to Z or his order” \\nand signing the endorsement.

A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws \\nthe bill upon the paper pursuant to A's intention, B is also guilty of forgery. \\n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending \\nto cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery. \\n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decre e against B.
